<h2> Inside the Acoustic Piano: How does it work? </h2> 

<img src= "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0bXy_7bj1v8/maxresdefault.jpg"> <! to use "img src" to put in an image, set the link to what shows up when you open an image in a new tab> 
   

<p> An Acoustic Piano is simply a piano that isn't digital; the sounds don't come from any speaker, and it's definitely my piano of choice, as the sounds that come from it are of much higher quality. Also, it allows the player to produce a depth of sound unmatched by any digital piano I've seen by pressing a key harder. As you press a key on an acoustic piano,it causes a little hammer to hit multiple strings inside. This in turn causes the strings to vibrate, producing a sound tuned to a specific key/note.</p>

<h2> Versatility of the Piano </h2>

<p> I would say that the piano is by far the most versatile instrument, just because of the number of different notes you can play at the same time. Because of this, the piano can deliver a volume and pitch that is second to none, which opens the door to playing almost every genre in existence on the piano! </p>

<h2> Easiness to Learn</h2>

<img src= "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/0a/Teach-Yourself-to-Play-the-Piano-Step-3-Version-3.jpg/v4-460px-Teach-Yourself-to-Play-the-Piano-Step-3-Version-3.jpg.webp"> 

<p> Another great thing about the piano is its easiness to learn. With just a bit of instruction, even you can learn to play some nice tunes in a relatively short amount of time! However, many people say this about the piano: It's an easy instrument to learn, but the hardest to master. I love the potential of the piano, especially because even when you think you're close to mastering it, all you have to do is listen to a pro play, and you'll realize how much more you can improve! That said, the piano is still a great instrument to learn!</p>

<h2> My Favorite Pianist</h2>

<p> Evgeny Kissin. Evgeny Kissin. Evgeny Kissin. Every time I listen to him, I'm filled with a mixture of awe and inspiration. The clarity in which he plays and the depth of sound he's able to put into every note is just amazing. If I could describe it, I would, but I can't, so I'll let you see for yourself. :) </p>

<p> Here's a recording of Evgeny Kissin playing my favorite piano piece!</p>
