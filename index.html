<h2> Inside the Acoustic Piano: How does it work? </h2>

<p> An Acoustic Piano is simply a piano that isn't digital; the sounds don't come from any speaker, and it's definitely my piano of choice, as the sounds that come from it are of much higher definition. Also, it allows the player to produce a depth of sound unmatched by any digital piano I've seen by pressing a key harder. As you press a key on an acoustic piano,it causes a little hammer to hit multiple strings inside. This in turn causes the strings to vibrate, producing a sound tuned to a specific key/note.  </p>

<h2> Versatility of the Piano </h2>

<p> I would say that the piano is by far the most versatile instrument, just because of the number of different notes you can play at the same time. Because of this, the piano can deliver a volume and pitch second to none, which opens the door to playing almost every genre in existence on the piano! </p>
