<h2> Inside the Acoustic Piano: How does it work? </h2>

<p> An Acoustic Piano is simply a piano that isn't digital; the sounds don't come from any speaker, and it's definitely my piano of choice, as the sounds that come from it are of much higher definition. Also, it allows the player to produce a depth of sound unmatched by any digital piano I've seen by pressing a key harder. As you press a key on an acoustic piano,it causes a little hammer to hit multiple strings inside. This in turn causes the strings to vibrate, producing a sound tuned to a specific key/note.  </p>
